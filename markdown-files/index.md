## Welcome to Open 5th Edition
Open5e is a an open-source 5th edition resource focused on OGC and homebrew content.

Our first project is the conversion of the SRD into markdown for easy portability across the web. After that, we'll be working to add open homebrew content from across the web and build out tools to make finding and tracking content even easier.

### Do you git? We could use your help!
We are currently building out our initial featureset, and we could use your help! Contribute on github (https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e) and help us make the open-source version of 5e the best version of 5e.
