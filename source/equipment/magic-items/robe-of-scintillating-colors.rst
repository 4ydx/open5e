Robe of Scintillating Colors
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to
cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until
the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light
in a 30-­foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures
that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In
addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the
robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
become stunned until the effect ends.

Robe of Stars
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver
stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly
large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of
the stars and use it to cast *magic missile* as a 5th-­level spell.
Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane
along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there
until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You
reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied,
the nearest unoccupied space.
