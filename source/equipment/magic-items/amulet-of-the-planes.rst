Amulet of the Planes
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that
you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15
Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the *plane shift*
spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of
you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel
to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to
a randomly determined plane of existence.

Animated Shield
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)*

While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus
action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers
in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your
hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a
bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die,
at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you
have one free.
