Efficient Quiver
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional
space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing
more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty
arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to
eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up
to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular
quiver or scabbard.

Efreeti Bottle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, very rare*

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to
remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At
the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless
fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of
you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what
happens.

=======  ==========================================================
d100     Effect
=======  ==========================================================
01–10    The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.
11–90    The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.
91–00    The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.

Elemental Gem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to
break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the *conjure
elemental* spell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem
determines the elemental summoned by the spell.
