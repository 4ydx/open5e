<p><em>Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon</em></p>
<p>This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest
substances in existence. While you’re wearing it, any critical hit
against you becomes a normal hit.</p>

<p>While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that
you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15
Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the <em>plane shift</em>
spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of
you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel
to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to
a randomly determined plane of existence.</p>

<p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus
action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers
in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your
hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a
bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die,
at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you
have one free.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="apparatus-of-the-crab">
<h2>Apparatus of the Crab<a class="headerlink" href="#apparatus-of-the-crab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p>
<p>This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500
pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a
successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch
unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller
creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end,
each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain
levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.</p>
<p>The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following
statistics:</p>
<p>Armor Class: 20</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 200</p>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail
aren’t extended)</p>
<p><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison, psychic</p>
<p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the
apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.
The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by
the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
<p>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of
900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per
minute from pressure.</p>
<p>A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two
of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back
to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as
shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.</p>

<p><em>Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor.
Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to
nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the
armor. Once this special action is used, it can’t be used again until
the next dawn.</p>

GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="arrow-of-slaying">
<h2>Arrow of Slaying<a class="headerlink" href="#arrow-of-slaying" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Weapon (arrow), very rare</em></p>
<p>An <em>arrow of slaying</em> is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind
of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are
both <em>arrows of dragon slaying</em> and <em>arrows of blue dragon slaying</em>. If
a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an
<em>arrow of slaying</em> takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a
DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on
a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>Once an <em>arrow of slaying</em> deals its extra damage to</p>
<p>a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.</p>
<p>Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as <em>bolts of
slaying</em> meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bag-of-beans">
<h2>Bag of Beans<a class="headerlink" href="#bag-of-beans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound
plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.</p>
<p>If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a
10-­foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area,
including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The
fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or
carried.</p>
<p>If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then
water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground
where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following
table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.</p>
<p><strong>d100 Effect</strong></p>
<p>01 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die.
On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an
even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.</p>
<p>02–10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar,
wine, or oil (GM’s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.</p>
<p>11–20 A treant sprouts. There’s a 50 percent chance that the treant is
chaotic evil and attacks.</p>
<p>21–30 An animate, immobile stone statue in your</p>
<p>likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and
others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and
directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same
plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue
becomes inanimate after 24 hours.</p>
<p>31–40 A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours
(or until it is extinguished).</p>
<p>41–50 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout</p>
<p>51–60 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched,
it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice. The
monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink
smoke.</p>
<p>61–70 A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks. 71–80 A fruit tree grows.
It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of</p>
<p>which act as randomly determined magic</p>
<p>potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM’s choice. The
tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic
for 30 days.</p>
<p>81–90 A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature</p>
<p>that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a
successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability
score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed
save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical
explosion.</p>
<p>91–99 A pyramid with a 60-­‐foot-­‐square base bursts upward. Inside is
a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the
mummy lord’s lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM’s
choice.</p>
<p>00 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM’s choice.
The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud
giant’s castle, or a different plane of existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bag-of-devouring">
<h2>Bag of Devouring<a class="headerlink" href="#bag-of-devouring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p>
<p>This bag superficially resembles a <em>bag of holding</em> but is a feeding
orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside
out closes the orifice.</p>
<p>The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is
placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is
placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a
50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature
inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC
15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the
bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength
check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that
starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p>
<p>Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot
of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects
inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM
determines the time and plane.</p>
<p>If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained
within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bag-of-holding">
<h2>Bag of Holding<a class="headerlink" href="#bag-of-holding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside
dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The
bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of</p>
<p>its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
<p>If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is
destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the
bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the
bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures
inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided
by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they
begin to suffocate.</p>
<p>Placing a <em>bag of holding</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a
<em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys
both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10
feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral
Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-­way only and can’t be
reopened.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bag-of-tricks">
<h2>Bag of Tricks<a class="headerlink" href="#bag-of-tricks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty.
Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy
object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.</p>
<p>You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from</p>
<p>the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms
into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table
that corresponds to the bag’s color.</p>
<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your
turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and
what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders,
such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the
creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.</p>
<p>Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be
used again until the next dawn.</p>

<h2>Bead of Force<a class="headerlink" href="#bead-of-force" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs
an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 <em>beads of force</em> are found together.</p>
<p>You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes
on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-­foot radius of
where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or
take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the
area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely
within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded
on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the
center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable
air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.</p>
<p>An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s
wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The
sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound,
regardless of the weight of creatures inside.</p>

<h2>Candle of Invocation<a class="headerlink" href="#candle-of-invocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s
alignment. The candle’s alignment can be detected with the <em>detect evil
and good</em> spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or
determines the alignment randomly.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>d20 Alignment</strong></p>

<p>14–15 Lawful evil</p>
<p>16–17 Lawful neutral</p>
<p>18–20 Lawful good</p>

<p>The candle’s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires
an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can
snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in
increments of 1 minute from the candle’s total burn time.</p>
<p>While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-­foot</p>
<p>radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of
the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with
advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment
matches the candle’s can cast 1st-­ level spells he or she has prepared
without expending spell slots, though the spell’s effect is as if cast
with a 1st-­level slot.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can
cast the <em>gate</em> spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.</p>

it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory
creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically
anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the
illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass
through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature
identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>*Balance.*</strong> Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your
alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice
versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on
you.</p>
<p><strong>*Comet.*</strong> If you single-­handedly defeat the next hostile monster or
group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to
gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>
<p><strong>*Donjon.*</strong> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended
animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and
carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared.
You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere.
You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a <em>wish</em> spell can
reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>
<p><strong>*Euryale.*</strong> The card’s medusa-­like visage curses you. You take a −2
penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the
magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</p>
<p><strong>*The Fates.*</strong> Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you
to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the
card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before
you die.</p>
<p><strong>*Flames.*</strong> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your
ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to
slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>
<p>help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain
by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.</p>

gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>
<p><strong>*Idiot.*</strong> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a
minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your
declared draws.</p>
<p><strong>*Jester.*</strong> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards
beyond your declared draws.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>*Key.*</strong> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you</div></blockquote>
<p>are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>*Knight.*</strong> You gain the service of a 4th-­level fighter who appears
in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same
race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have
drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>*Moon.*</strong> You are granted the ability to cast the <em>wish</em></div></blockquote>
<p>spell 1d3 times.</p>
<p><strong>*Rogue.*</strong> A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile
toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or
someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a <em>wish</em> spell or divine
intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.</p>
<p><strong>*Ruin.*</strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic
items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses,
buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the
least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to
this card also disappears.</p>
<p><strong>*Skull.*</strong> You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton
clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears
in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you,
warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights
until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If
anyone tries to</p>

<p><strong>*Sun.*</strong> You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM
determines randomly) appears in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>*Talons.*</strong> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates.
Artifacts in your possession aren’t destroyed but do vanish.</p>
<p><strong>*Throne.*</strong> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you
double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In
addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the
world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which
you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.</p>
<p><strong>*Vizier.*</strong> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this
card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a
truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps
you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the
knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.</p>
<p><strong>*The Void.*</strong> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from
your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One
or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in
this way, your body is incapacitated. A <em>wish</em> spell can’t restore your
soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it.
You draw no more cards.</p>

<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated
creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size.
In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a</p>
<p>creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional
movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of
existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an
interdimensional portal.</p>
<p>You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an
action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a
DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free
and destroys the shackles.</p>

<div><em>Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes
dragons collect their cast-­off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other
times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In
either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.</p>
<p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage
on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of
dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined
by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).</p>
<p>Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically
discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles
of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t
be used again until the next dawn.</p>

<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens

<p><strong>*Anchor.*</strong> You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or
ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means.
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect
ends, the token disappears.</p>
<p><strong>*Bird.*</strong> You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air.
The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.
The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands
and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its
maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with
a one-­hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half
that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a
day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an
action.</p>
<p><strong>*Fan.*</strong> If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss
the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant
flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong
enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its</p>
<p>speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an
action.</p>
<p><strong>*Swan Boat.*</strong> You can use an action to touch the token to a body of
water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a
50-­foot-­long, 20-­foot-­ wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place.
The boat is self-­propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles
per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move
or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-­two Medium
or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures,
while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and
then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.</p>
<p><strong>*Tree.*</strong> You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an
action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into
existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-­foot-­diameter trunk,
and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-­foot radius.</p>
<p><strong>*Whip.*</strong> You can use an action to throw the token to reverts to its
figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit
points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while
touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property
can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as
specified in the figurine’s description.</p>
<p><strong>*Bronze Griffon (Rare).*</strong> This bronze statuette is of a griffon
rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been

<h2>Figurine of Wondrous Power<a class="headerlink" href="#figurine-of-wondrous-power" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rarity by figurine</em></p>
<p>A <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is a statuette of a beast small enough to
fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and
throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the
figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature
would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there
isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a
creature.</p>
<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your
languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the
creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end
of the duration, the creature</p>
<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10</p>
<p>Languages —</p>
<p><strong>*Golden Lions (Rare).*</strong> These gold statuettes of lions are always
created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each
can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can’t
be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
<p><strong>*Ivory Goats (Rare).*</strong> These ivory statuettes of goats are always
created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions
differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same
statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or
portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has
charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of
charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7
days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>
<li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it
has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>
<li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat
can’t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons.
One horn becomes a <em>+1 lance</em>, and the other becomes a <em>+2
longsword</em>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons
disappear and the horns return
whenthegoatrevertstofigurineform.Inaddition, the goat radiates a
30-­foot-­radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature
hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC
15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or
until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the
effect, a creature is immune to the goat’s aura for the next 24
hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until
15 days have passed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*Marble Elephant (Rare).*</strong> This marble statuette is about 4 inches
high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has
been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
<p><strong>*Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).*</strong> This polished obsidian horse can
become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to
defend itself. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5
days have passed.</p>
<p>If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each
time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to
figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your
orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random
location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine
form.</p>
<p><strong>*Onyx Dog (Rare).*</strong> This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff
for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak
Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see
invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been
used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
<p><strong>*Serpentine Owl (Rare).*</strong> This serpentine statuette of an owl can
become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be
used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically
communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of
existence.</p>
<p><strong>*Silver Raven (Uncommon).*</strong> This silver statuette of a raven can
become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be
used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine
allows you to cast the <em>animal messenger</em> spell on it at will.</p>

causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light
in a 40-­foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the
sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it
hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command

<h2>Folding Boat<a class="headerlink" href="#folding-boat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6
inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be
opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words,
each requiring you to use an action to speak it.</p>
<p>One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4
feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a
mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures
comfortably.</p>
<p>The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet
long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats,
five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast
with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures
comfortably.</p>
<p>When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal
vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the
boat.</p>
<p>The third command word causes the <em>folding boat</em> to fold back into a
box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel
that can’t fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any
objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.</p>

<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an
action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following
effects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a
30-­foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect
doesn’t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to
repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.</li>
<li>The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a
brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of
you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success.</li>

<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is
an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of
material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central
pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack
always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p>
<p>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for
interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires
you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific
item, the item is always magically on top.</p>
<p>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp
object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed.
If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although
an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned
inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must
be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is
placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10
minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>
<p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>bag
of holding</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both
items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where
the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of
the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the
Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-­way only and can’t
be reopened.</p>

undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.</li>
<li>As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to
fire damage.</li>
<li>As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action

into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-­foot radius and
dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you

of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm
emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60
feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw or be</p>

remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses
it, which works only if the fortress is empty.</p>
<p>The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with
arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is
divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect
them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated,
the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only
at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to

opening</em>.</p>
<p>Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15

creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the

this damage and are pushed automatically.</p>

tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points,</p>
<p>immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and
resistance to all other damage. Only a <em>wish</em> spell can repair the
fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th

<p><strong>*Regeneration (Legendary).*</strong> You regain 15 hit points at the end of
each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you
have at least 1 hit point.</p>
<p><strong>*Reserve (Rare).*</strong> This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into
it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels
worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of
stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>
<p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by
touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to
be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is
expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell
determines how much space it uses.</p>
<p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it.
The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and
spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as
if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored
in it, freeing up space.</p>
<p><strong>*Strength (Very Rare).*</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, to a

<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound.
You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at
a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the
sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.</p>
<p>Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity

the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.</p>
<p>A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC

<h2>Iron Flask<a class="headerlink" href="#iron-flask" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p>
<p>This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the
flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60
feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than
the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving
throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the
flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a
creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only
one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to
breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.</p>
<p>You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the
creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your
companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you
give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its
death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of
the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal
disposition and alignment.</p>
<p>An <em>identify</em> spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the
only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly
discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or

<div><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p>
<p>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush
(weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create
three-­dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The
paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you
concentrate on its image.</p>
<p>Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a
surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain
features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or
weapons— that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to
cover 100 square feet.</p>
<p>When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature
depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on
a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is
beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth
counts against the total area of objects you create.</p>
<p>Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp.
If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile
of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals
it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p>

faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC
11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters
and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
<p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet

It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word
again.</p>
<p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated
mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or
carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This
saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s
nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.</p>
<p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog
that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s
cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature
trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel.
Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p>
<p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are
already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to
accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied
space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror
is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in
unoccupied spaces near it.</p>

normally.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where
it covers a 10-­foot square, duplicating the effect of the <em>grease</em>

<p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They

you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the

<h2>Pipes of the Sewers<a class="headerlink" href="#pipes-of-the-sewers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While
you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are
indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or
harm them.</p>
<p>The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can
use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of
rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within
half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the
GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted.
Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but
aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended
charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p>Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control
comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can
make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose
the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed
by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest,</p>
<p>the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and
your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round
as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no
commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no
actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’
music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it
normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24
hours.</p>

<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a
handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.</p>
<p>You can use an action to unfold a <em>portable hole</em> and place it on or
against a solid surface, whereupon the <em>portable hole</em> creates an
extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the
hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open
passages. Any creature inside an open <em>portable hole</em> can exit the hole
by climbing out of it.</p>
<p>You can use an action to close a <em>portable hole</em> by taking hold of the
edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole,
and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional
space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p>
<p>If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional
space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful
check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the
<em>portable hole</em> or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within
a closed <em>portable hole</em> can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which
time it begins to suffocate.</p>
<p>Placing a <em>portable hole</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a
<em>bag of holding</em>, <em>handy haversack</em>, or similar item instantly destroys
both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10
feet of the gate is sucked through</p>
<p>it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then
closes. The gate is one-­way only and can’t be reopened.</p>

<h2>Ring of Shooting Stars<a class="headerlink" href="#ring-of-shooting-stars" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Ring, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast <em>dancing
lights</em> and <em>light</em> from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the
ring requires an action.</p>
<p>The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring
regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>*Faerie Fire.*</strong> You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast <em>faerie
fire</em> from the ring.</p>
<p><strong>*Ball Lightning.*</strong> You can expend 2 charges as an action to create
one to four 3-­foot-­diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you
create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.</p>
<p>Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet
of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating
on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-­foot
radius.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no
farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you
comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that
creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage
based on the number of spheres you created.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Spheres Lightning Damage</strong></p>
<p>4 2d4</p>
<p>3 2d6</p>
<p>2 5d4</p>
<p>1 4d12</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>*Shooting Stars.*</strong> You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For
every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the
ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within
a 15-­foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<h2>Ring of Spell Storing<a class="headerlink" href="#ring-of-spell-storing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned
wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a
time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by
the GM.</p>
<p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by
touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other
than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the
spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the
spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell
uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting
ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast
the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it,
freeing up space.</p>

spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if
you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the

slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the
caster.</p>

its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you.
The ring produces a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with a
+7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10
force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s charges as an action

<h2>Rod of Absorption<a class="headerlink" href="#rod-of-absorption" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that
is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed
spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell
itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell
when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy
over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of
energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the
rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p>
<p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy
the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many
levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p>
<p>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored
in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can
create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell
slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place
of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you
can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-­level spell slot.</p>
<p>A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already.
A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining

<p>This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.</p>
<p><strong>*Alertness.*</strong> While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.</p>
<p><strong>*Spells.*</strong> While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one
of the following spells from it:</p>
<p><em>detect evil and good</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>detect poison and disease</em>, or
<em>see invisibility.</em></p>
<p><strong>*Protective Aura.*</strong> As an action, you can plant the haft end of the
rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a
60-­foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that
bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1
bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any
invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.</p>
<p>The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends</p>

<div class="section" id="rod-of-lordly-might">
<h2>Rod of Lordly Might<a class="headerlink" href="#rod-of-lordly-might" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Rod, legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that
grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has
properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row
along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>
<p><strong>*Six Buttons.*</strong> You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus
action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or
until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to
its normal form.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a <em>flame</em></p>
<p><em>tongue</em>, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s
flanged head.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two
crescent-­shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic
battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
it.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear
point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a
6-­foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to
50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at
the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3
inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The
pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring
causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering
ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break
through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form
and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the
rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also
gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your
height above it.</p>
<p><strong>*Drain Life.*</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the
rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.
On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you
regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<p><strong>*Paralyze.*</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the
rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On
a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<p><strong>*Terrify.*</strong> While holding the rod, you can use an action to force
each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute.
A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t
be used again until the next dawn.</p>

<h2>Rod of Rulership<a class="headerlink" href="#rod-of-rulership" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>You can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each
creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each
target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you
for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its
trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do
something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this
way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

<div class="section" id="rod-of-security">
<h2>Rod of Security<a class="headerlink" href="#rod-of-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Rod, very rare</em></p>
<p>While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod
then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you
can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose
the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely
glade, cheery tavern,</p>
<p>immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else
you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough
water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be
interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For
example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it
is taken outside the extraplanar space.</p>
<p>For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if
it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise,
although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for
up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).</p>
<p>When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors
reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an
unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again
until ten days have passed.</p>

the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10
feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your
turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or
until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself
securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself,
or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
<p>If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-­ foot intervals
along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-­foot length
and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>
<p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5
minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0

darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you.
The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become
restrained.</p>
<p>You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second
command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make
a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the
creature is no longer restrained by the rope.</p>

<h2>Spell Scroll<a class="headerlink" href="#spell-scroll" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scroll, varies</em></p>
<p>A <em>spell scroll</em> bears the words of a single spell, written in a
mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use
an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to
provide any of the spell’s components. Otherwise, the scroll is
unintelligible.</p>
<p>If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than
you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your
spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The</p>
<p>DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell
disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell is cast,
the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.</p>
<p>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw
DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the

<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p>
<p>This 2-­foot-­diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse,
hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.</p>
<p>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that
passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is
susceptible to damage from a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, it passes through
the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t
wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.</p>
<p>The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60
feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25
Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one
direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your
Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves
10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must
succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking
4d10 force damage.</p>
<p>If you attempt to control a sphere that is under</p>
<p>another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check
contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The
winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as
normal.</p>
<p>If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that
created by the <em>gate</em> spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that
within a <em>portable hole</em>, the GM determines randomly what happens, using
the following table.</p>

<p>When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack

sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.</p>
<p>In addition, you can speak the sword’s command word to cause the blade
to shed bright light in a 10-­ foot radius and dim light for an

<p>01–05 You cast slow. 06–10 You cast faerie fire.</p>
<p>11–15 You are stunned until the start of your next turn,</p>
<p>believing something awesome just happened. 16–20 You cast gust of
wind.</p>
<p>21–25 You cast detect thoughts on the target you chose. If you
didn’t target a creature, you instead take 1d6 psychic damage.</p>
<p>26–30 You cast stinking cloud.</p>
<p>31–33 Heavy rain falls in a 60-­‐foot radius centered on</p>
<p>the target. The area becomes lightly obscured. The rain falls until
the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>34–36 An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target.

Roll a d100 to determine which animal appears. On a 01–25, a
rhinoceros appears; on a 26–50, an elephant appears; and on a

Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet
of the target, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.</p>

yourself.</p>
<p>70–79 You cast fireball.</p>
<p>80–84 You cast invisibility on yourself.</p>
<p>85–87 Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in space as
the target, leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point.

24 hours.</p>

wand’s tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1
bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided
equally among all creatures in the line.</p>

30-­‐foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded
for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
<p>96–97 The target’s skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days.</p>
<p>If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is
affected.</p>
<p>98–00 If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw. If you didn’t target a creature, you become the target
and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or
more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save,
the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While
restrained in this</p>
<p>way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next
turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a
success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the

<p><strong>Sentient Magic Items</strong></p>
<p>Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might
be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-­aware
thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves
like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and
sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its
wielder or a continual thorn in the side.</p>
<p>Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest
sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never
sentient.</p>
<p>Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any
activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its
wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the
item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the
relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties
or even turn them against the wielder.</p>

<h3>Conflict<a class="headerlink" href="#conflict" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and
alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s
alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs,
the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma
check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the
following demands:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.</li>
<li>The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds
repugnant.</li>
<li>The item demands that its wielder pursue the item’s goals to the
exclusion of all other goals.</li>
<li>The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses
to comply with the item’s wishes, the item can do any or all of the
following:</li>
<li>Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.</li>
<li>Suppress one or more of its activated properties.</li>
<li>Attempt to take control of its wielder.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder
must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s
Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item
for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s
commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw,
ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user
succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next
dawn.</p>

<h2>Orb of Dragonkind<a class="headerlink" href="#orb-of-dragonkind" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons.
When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked
their greatest magic, forging five <em>Orbs of Dragonkind</em> (or <em>Dragon
Orbs</em>) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the
five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a
victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then
destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>
<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or
faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic
has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their
primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some
measure of control over dragons.</p>
<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents
any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality
might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>
<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When
used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside
it.</p>
<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s
depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma
check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you
remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb
for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>
<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your
attunement to it, and the orb casts <em>suggestion</em> on you at will (save DC
18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon
essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a
particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the
world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM
decides.</p>
<p><strong>*Random Properties.*</strong> An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has the</p>
<p>following random properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
<li>1 major detrimental property</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*Spells.*</strong> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges
daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend
1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from
it: <em>cure wounds</em> (5th-­level version, 3 charges), <em>daylight</em> (1
charge), <em>death ward</em> (2 charges), or <em>scrying</em> (3 charges). You can
also use an action to cast the <em>detect magic</em> spell from the orb without
using any charges.</p>
<p><strong>*Call Dragons.*</strong> While you control the orb, you can use an action to
cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all
directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to
the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities
such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb
might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once
you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>*Destroying an Orb.*</strong> An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> appears</p>
<p>fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and
breath weapons of dragons. A <em>disintegrate</em> spell or one good hit from a
+3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.</p>
