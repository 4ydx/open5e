Grapple Rules for Monsters
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

    Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly
    grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t
    need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the
    grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.

    A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to
    escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or
    Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s
    stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the
    monster’s Strength (Athletics) modifier.
