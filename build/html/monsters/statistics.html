<blockquote>
<div>Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might
be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part
of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it
into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or
two from a different monster or by using a <strong>variant</strong> or
<strong>template</strong>, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that
modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it,
might change its challenge rating.</div></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="type">
<h1>Type<a class="headerlink" href="#type" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic
items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special
ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an <em>arrow of
dragon slaying</em> deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other
creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.</p>
<p>The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of
their own.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings. Many of</div></blockquote>
<p>them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind
rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential
aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a</div></blockquote>
<p>natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them</p>
<p>have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or
language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs,
and giant versions of animals.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper</div></blockquote>
<p>Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers
or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are
good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good
alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls,
and pegasi.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are</div></blockquote>
<p>programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions,
while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent
thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the
outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the
raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient</div></blockquote>
<p>origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic
dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have
innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to
true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical,
such as wyverns and pseudodragons.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental</div></blockquote>
<p>planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses
of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called
elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy.
The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important
civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include
azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces</div></blockquote>
<p>of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some
worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of
Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes
of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native</div></blockquote>
<p>to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more
labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests
and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their
bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost
inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas,
and yugoloths.</p>
<p><strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in
shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities
(fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone
giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants.
Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy</div></blockquote>
<p>gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a
tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few
if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn
spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are
the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and
halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost
uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and
bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest</div></blockquote>
<p>sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural,
and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation
gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible
curses (including minotaurs and yuan-­ti). They defy categorization, and
in some sense serve as a catch-­all category for creatures that don’t
fit into any other type.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a</div></blockquote>
<p>fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and
dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to
get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most
recognizable oozes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not</div></blockquote>
<p>ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous.
The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal
creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this
category.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Undead</strong> are once-­living creatures brought to a</div></blockquote>
<p>horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or
some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and
zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.</p>
<div class="section" id="tags">
<h2>Tags<a class="headerlink" href="#tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in
parentheses. For example, an orc has the <em>humanoid (orc)</em> type. The
parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain
creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the</p>
<p>game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear
that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any
monster that has the demon tag.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alignment">
<h1>Alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#alignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it
behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic
evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack
characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to
negotiate. See the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> for descriptions of the different
alignments.</p>
<p>The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel
free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the
needs of your campaign. If you want a good-­aligned green dragon or an
evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Some creatures can have <strong>any alignment</strong>. In other</div></blockquote>
<p>words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment
entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil.
For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good,
chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.</p>
<p>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or
chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but
rather act on instinct. These creatures are <strong>unaligned</strong>, which means
they don’t have an alignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="armor-class">
<h1>Armor Class<a class="headerlink" href="#armor-class" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC)
that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a
monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if
any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield,
this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hit-points">
<h1>Hit Points<a class="headerlink" href="#hit-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.
For more on hit points, see the <em>Player’s Handbook.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div>A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die</div></blockquote>
<p>expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit
points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).</p>
<p>A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as
shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit
points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number
of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points.

2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).</div></blockquote>

<h2>Spellcasting<a class="headerlink" href="#spellcasting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster
level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level
and higher (as explained in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>). The
spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the
feature.</p>
<p>The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific
class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that
class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid
Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of
that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires
membership in the class or access to its spell list.</p>
<p>A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has
the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the
3rd-­level <em>lightning bolt</em> spell can cast it as a 5th-­level spell
by using one of its 5th-­level</p>
<p>greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<div class="section" id="psionics">
<h2>Psionics<a class="headerlink" href="#psionics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the
psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special
trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of
the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically
doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="actions">
<h1>Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the
Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to
all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the
<em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="melee-and-ranged-attacks">
<h2>Melee and Ranged Attacks<a class="headerlink" href="#melee-and-ranged-attacks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and
ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the
“weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a
claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks,
see the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>*Creature vs. Target.*</strong> The target of a melee or</div></blockquote>
<p>ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the
difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.</p>
<p><strong>*Hit.*</strong> Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of
an attack hitting a target are described after the “<em>Hit</em>” notation.
You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for
this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are
presented.</p>
<p><strong>*Miss.*</strong> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that
information is presented after the “<em>Miss:</em>” notation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiattack">
<h2>Multiattack<a class="headerlink" href="#multiattack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the
Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an
opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ammunition">
<h2>Ammunition<a class="headerlink" href="#ammunition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can
assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon
attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a
bow or crossbow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reactions">
<h1>Reactions<a class="headerlink" href="#reactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that
information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction,
this section is absent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="limited-usage">
<h1>Limited Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#limited-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can
be used.</p>
<p><strong>*X/Day.*</strong> The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X
number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain
expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used
once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.</p>
<p><strong>*Recharge X–Y.*</strong> The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a monster can use
a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of
recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each
of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in
the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special
ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or
long rest.</p>
<p>For example, “Recharge 5–6” means a monster can use the special ability
once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of
that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>*Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.*</strong> This notation means that
a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a
short or long rest to use it again.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equipment">
<h1>Equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons
used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a
humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.</p>
<p>You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you
like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable
after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still
usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by
someone else, for instance.</p>
<p>If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells,
assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells
in its stat block.</p>
