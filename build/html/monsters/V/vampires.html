<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water,
it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud
of mist, or back into its true form.</div>
<div class="line">While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak, its walking speed is 5
feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than
its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms
with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form
if it dies.</div>
<div class="line">While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or
manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet,
can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In
addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without
squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune
to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.
<strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the vampire fails a saving throw,
it can choose to succeed instead. <strong>Misty Escape</strong>: When it drops to 0
hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a
cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling
unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running water. If
it can’t transform, it is destroyed.</div>
<div class="line">While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire
form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be
destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form.
It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After
spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1
hit point. <strong>Regeneration</strong>: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the
start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight
or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from
holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s
next turn. <strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces,
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability
check. <strong>Vampire Weaknesses</strong>: The vampire has the following flaws:
<strong>Forbiddance</strong>: The vampire can’t enter a residence without an
invitation from one of the occupants.</div>
</div>
<!-- --><p><strong>Harmed by Running Water</strong>: The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends
its turn in running water.</p>
<!-- --><p><strong>Stake to the Heart</strong>: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into
the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting
place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</p>
<!-- --><p><strong>Sunlight Hypersensitivity</strong>: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when
it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage
on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p>Actions</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: The vampire makes two attacks,
only one of which can be a bite attack. <strong>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form
Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
<em>Hit</em>: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the
vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18). <strong>Bite (Bat or Vampire
Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire,
incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus
10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by
an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains
hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target
finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit
point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in
the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the
vampire’s control. <strong>Charm</strong>: The vampire targets one humanoid it can
see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the
target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic
or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire
as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target
isn’t under the vampire’s control, it takes the vampire’s requests or
actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target
for the vampire’s bite attack.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Each time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful
to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on
itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the
vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the
target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. <strong>Children of the
Night (1/Day)</strong>: The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or
rats, provided that the sun isn’t up. While outdoors, the vampire can
call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds,
acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The
beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire
dismisses them as a bonus action.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Legendary Actions</p>
<p>The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The vampire regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><strong>Move</strong>: The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking
opportunity attacks.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Unarmed Strike</strong>: The vampire makes one unarmed strike. <strong>Bite
(Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The vampire makes one bite attack.</div>
