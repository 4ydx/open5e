<h1>Movement and Position<a class="headerlink" href="#movement-and-position" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using
movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as
much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the
rules here.</p>
<p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These
different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can
constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the
distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up
or until you are done moving.</p>
<div class="section" id="breaking-up-your-move">
<h2>Breaking Up Your Move<a class="headerlink" href="#breaking-up-your-move" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed
before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30
feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>
<div class="section" id="moving-between-attacks">
<h3>Moving between Attacks<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-between-attacks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can
break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For
example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack
feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an
attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-different-speeds">
<h3>Using Different Speeds<a class="headerlink" href="#using-different-speeds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying
speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your
move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved
from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move.
If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the
current move.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because
a wizard cast the <em>fly</em> spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk
10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="difficult-terrain">
<h2>Difficult Terrain<a class="headerlink" href="#difficult-terrain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.
Boulder-­strewn caverns, briar-­ choked forests, treacherous
staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This
rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult
terrain.</p>
<p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs
are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature,
whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="being-prone">
<h2>Being Prone<a class="headerlink" href="#being-prone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because
they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the
game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You can <strong>drop prone</strong> without using any of your</div></blockquote>
<p>speed. <strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of
movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30
feet, you must spend</p>
<p>15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have
enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To move while prone, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use</div></blockquote>
<p>magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs
1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3
feet of movement.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem
with your movement and action:</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>
<li>open or close a door</li>
<li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>
<li>pick up a dropped axe</li>
<li>take a bauble from a table</li>
<li>remove a ring from your finger</li>
<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>
<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>
<li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>
<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>
<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>
<li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>
<li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>
<li>extinguish a small flame</li>
<li>don a mask</li>
<li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li>
<li>put your ear to a door</li>
<li>kick a small stone</li>
<li>turn a key in a lock</li>
<li>tap the floor with a 10-­‐foot pole</li>
<li>hand an item to another character</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-around-other-creatures">
<h2>Moving Around Other Creatures<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-around-other-creatures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can
move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least
two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s
space is difficult terrain for you.</p>
<p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your
move in its space.</p>
<p>If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an
opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flying-movement">
<h2>Flying Movement<a class="headerlink" href="#flying-movement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also
deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone,
has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to
move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to</p>
<p>hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the <em>fly</em> spell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creature-size">
<h2>Creature Size<a class="headerlink" href="#creature-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories
table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in
combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>
<div class="section" id="size-categories">
<h3>Size Categories<a class="headerlink" href="#size-categories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Size Space</strong></p>
<p>Tiny 2½ by 2½ ft.</p>
<p>Small 5 by 5 ft.</p>
<p>Medium 5 by 5 ft.</p>
<p>Large 10 by 10 ft.</p>
<p>Huge 15 by 15 ft. Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="space">
<h3>Space<a class="headerlink" href="#space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in
combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium
creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space
that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-­ foot-­wide doorway,
other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to</div></blockquote>
<p>fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of
creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium
combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-­foot radius around another
one.</p>
<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround
a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller
one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty
Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="squeezing-into-a-smaller-space">
<h3>Squeezing into a Smaller Space<a class="headerlink" href="#squeezing-into-a-smaller-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a
creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze
through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a
space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there,
and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.
Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the
smaller space.</p>
