<h1>The Order of Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#the-order-of-combat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of
weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game
organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A
<strong>round</strong> represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round,
each participant in a battle takes a <strong>turn</strong>. The order of turns is
determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls
initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the
next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p>
<div class="section" id="combat-step-by-step">
<h2>Combat Step by Step<a class="headerlink" href="#combat-step-by-step" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Determine surprise.</strong> The GM determines whether anyone involved in
the combat encounter is surprised.</li>
<li><strong>Establish positions.</strong> The GM decides where all the characters and
monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their
stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out
where the adversaries are̶ how far away and in what direction.</li>
<li><strong>Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls
initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.</li>
<li><strong>Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in
initiative order.</li>
<li><strong>Begin the next round.</strong> When everyone involved in the combat has
had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Surprise</strong></p>
<p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the
trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage,
unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In
these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.</p>
<p>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be
stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM
compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the
passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side.
Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at
the start of the encounter.</p>
<p>If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn
of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A
member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.</p>
<div class="section" id="initiative">
<h3>Initiative<a class="headerlink" href="#initiative" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat
starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their
place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group
of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same
time.</p>
<p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest
Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order
(called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The
initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p>
<p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-­controlled
creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.
The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player
character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters
each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>

<div class="section" id="your-turn">
<h3>Your Turn<a class="headerlink" href="#your-turn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On your turn, you can <strong>move</strong> a distance up to your speed and <strong>take
one action</strong>. You decide whether to move first or take your action
first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your
character sheet.</p>
<p>The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in
Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other
abilities provide additional options for your action.</p>
<p>The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the
rules for your move.</p>
<p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your
turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the
Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”</p>
<div class="section" id="bonus-actions">
<h4>Bonus Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#bonus-actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an
additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action
feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can
take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature
of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You
otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.</p>
<p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose
which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p>
<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the
bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of
your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus
action.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-activity-on-your-turn">
<h4>Other Activity on Your Turn<a class="headerlink" href="#other-activity-on-your-turn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your
action nor your move.</p>
<p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and
gestures, as you take your turn.</p>
<p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for
free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could
open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could
draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your
action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an
action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>
<p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities
when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For
instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reactions">
<h3>Reactions<a class="headerlink" href="#reactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a
special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a
trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s.
The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most
common type of reaction.</p>
<p>When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of
your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that
creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>
