<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and
a wisp of smoke)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range.
You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into
an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither
worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the
duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you
concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation
lasts until it is dispelled.</p>
<p>This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit
points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it
succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.</p>
<p><strong>*Creature into Creature.*</strong> If you turn a creature into another kind
of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge
rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the
target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics,
including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the
new form. It retains its alignment and personality.</p>
<p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts
to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it
had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0
hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long
as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit
points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of
its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action
that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such
actions.</p>
<p>The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate,
use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
<p><strong>*Object into Creature.*</strong> You can turn an object into any kind of
creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s
size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is
friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You
decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s
statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.</p>
<p>If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It
might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.</p>
<p><strong>*Creature into Object.*</strong> If you turn a creature into an object, it
transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that
form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the
creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends
and it returns to its normal form.</p>
